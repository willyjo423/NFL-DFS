"""How much of the field will own each player.

The measurement used to be closed
---------------------------------
DraftKings' standings endpoint returns a login page to a script - identically
139,263 bytes for a 182,000-entry contest and a 52,000-entry one, which is how
you know it is one generic wall rather than data. So for the whole life of this
module ownership was modelled against nothing, and the docstring said so.

That changed. A finished contest's standings CSV, exported from the browser,
carries a `%Drafted` column per player. One real board is now in hand:

    DK NFL Showdown, DET @ BUF, contest 195775024, 784 entries,
    58 priced players, 29 of them also on our published board.

Everything below is fitted against it. The numbers in CALIBRATION are the
actual field ownership from that contest and `check_calibration` re-scores the
model against them, so the claims in this docstring are executable rather than
editorial.

What the real board proved wrong
--------------------------------
The old version led with points and then leaned hard on points-per-dollar
(VALUE_WEIGHT 0.80, second-heaviest term). Measured against the field, value
is not weakly predictive - it is predictive with the WRONG SIGN:

    Spearman correlation with actual ownership, 29 players
        projected points alone      +0.86
        salary alone                +0.81
        points per $1,000           -0.42      <-- the old second-heaviest term
        the old blended appeal      +0.46

The field does not hunt value on a showdown slate. It rosters the expensive,
obvious players, and it rosters them roughly in projection order. Value is
what a model thinks a lineup should be built from; it is not what the person
clicking through the lobby in four minutes is looking at. Feeding it in with a
positive coefficient dragged the cheap end of the board up and the good players
down, and cost about half of the available rank correlation.

Two consequences, both visible in the contest:

  * Ownership was spread far too flat. The old model put 20% of all ownership
    on the cheapest fifteen players; the field put 8%. It had Ty Johnson at
    17.1% (actual 0.1%), Tyler Conklin 14.6% (actual 0.3%), Greg Dortch 15.6%
    (actual 1.1%). Nobody rosters the fourth tight end.

  * The genuinely popular players were called as contrarian. Dalton Kincaid
    came out at 6.4% against an actual 50.9%; DJ Moore 8.3% against 43.4%;
    Sam LaPorta 27.2% against 50.9%.

Retuning CONCENTRATION does not fix any of this, and that is worth stating
plainly because the old docstring named it as "the first thing to calibrate if
a real ownership file ever arrives". It was the wrong thing. Sweeping the
temperature from 0.5 to 6.0 moves mean absolute error from 12.6pp to 12.5pp -
temperature changes how steep a ranking is, and this ranking was not steep in
the wrong way, it was in the wrong ORDER. No temperature repairs an ordering.

What replaced it
----------------
Projected points, plus salary as its own positive term, plus a punt bonus that
now only reaches players with a real projection. Fitted by grid search on the
board above, minimising KL(actual || model) - not mean absolute error, because
MAE on a board where half the pool is owned near zero is minimised by staying
flat, which is the exact failure being repaired.

                          old        new     actual
    KL(actual||model)     0.427      0.179      -
    mean abs error        12.0pp      9.9pp     -
    Spearman rho           0.46       0.87      -
    share on top 8          62%        75%      74%
    share on bottom 15      20%        11%       8%

What this fit does NOT cover
----------------------------
One slate, one sport, one game type, 29 players. Specifically untested:

  * Classic boards. The scale constraint (`slot_demand`) is arithmetic and
    still holds, but the shape coefficients are fitted on showdown only.
  * MLB. The same contest export exists for MLB and has not been joined yet.
  * The ceiling term. The published board carries no ceiling column, so
    ceiling could not be separated from the median. It is folded into the
    points term at a fixed blend rather than given a free coefficient, which
    keeps the fitted points:salary ratio intact instead of quietly changing it.

Why it matters even as an estimate
----------------------------------
A tournament is not won by a good lineup; it is won by a good lineup nobody
else had. The same contest shows what the old errors cost: Jared Goff was
modelled at 59.2% owned, came in at 23.5%, and scored 32.78 - the largest
leverage play on the slate, and the model had it marked as chalk. He was in
four of the top five lineups.
